# Physiscs-Informed-Machine-Learning
This repository is a comprehensive collection of code, datasets, examples, and tutorials focused on the integration of physical laws and principles into machine learning models. The work here primarily revolves around embedding physical constraints and domain knowledge into various ML architectures to enhance model reliability, especially in data-scarce environments.

### What is Physics-Informed Machine Learning?
Physics-Informed Machine Learning is an emerging field at the intersection of physics and machine learning. It involves incorporating known physical laws (like those from fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, or quantum mechanics) into the structure of machine learning models. The goal is to guide and constrain these models within the bounds of physical reality, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex systems where data may be limited or expensive to acquire. This approach not only improves the predictive accuracy but also ensures the interpretability and generalizability of the models.
